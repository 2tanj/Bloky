# BlokyðŸŸª
"Bloky" is an exciting and addictive casual mobile game that challenges players to guide a
small square on an exhilarating journey upwards. As the player controls the square, their main
objective is to avoid obstacles while strategically utilizing them to ascend as high as possible.
The game adds a thrilling element of urgency by introducing a deadly floor that relentlessly
pursues the player, constantly accelerating in speed.

Players must exhibit quick reflexes and precise timing to dodge various obstacles, such as
moving platforms, rotating blades, and shifting barriers. By skilfully navigating through these
challenges, players can reach higher scores and unlock new levels and cosmetics, collecting
power-ups and bonus items along the way to aid their ascent.
